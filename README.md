# 🕵️ SpyID — Find Telegram User IDs by @username

**SpyID** is a simple Python script that allows you to retrieve the Telegram User ID of any public account by entering their `@username` — directly from the command line.

> ⚠️ You must log in with your own Telegram account via the [Telegram API](https://my.telegram.org) to use this tool. It does not work for private users or usernames that don’t exist.
